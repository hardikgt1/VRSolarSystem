The "VR Solar System" is an immersive and educational virtual reality (VR) application designed to provide users with an interactive way to explore and learn about the planets in our solar system. 
Developed using Unity and Visual Studio, the app aims to blend entertainment with education, allowing users to discover detailed planetary information in a visually engaging 3D environment. 
In the app, users can navigate through a realistic representation of the solar system. By interacting with the planets using VR 
controllers, they can access detailed information about each planet, such as its size, distance from the sun, and other fascinating characteristics. The app highlights the potential of VR technology for educational and exploratory purposes.
